# Data Analyst & Visualization Technical Assessment

## Objective

This assessment evaluates your SQL capability, analytical depth, and ability to translate data into actionable business strategy.
You are provided with infrastructure, subscription lifecycle, and media monetization data covering a 12-month period.
Please clearly state any assumptions made.

# Business Context

FiberCo builds and owns fiber infrastructure (homepass). Revenue is generated when ISP partners (Servco) activate end customers (Contract Account / CA).
Some fibernodes are exclusive to one Servco for a defined period, while others operate under open access (multi-ISP competition).
Servco 101 (XLS) has a minimum guarantee requirement.
MediaCo offers optional media products that can be bundled with internet subscriptions.
Each Media bundle will have different add-on products, and the price will also depend on those products.

Management’s objective:
- Improve infrastructure monetization
- Increase penetration
- Optimize Servco performance
- Maximize media contribution margin

# Section 1 – Infrastructure & Utilization

1. Calculate monthly penetration rate (Active CA / Total Homepass) by:
   - Region
   - Technology (FTTH vs HFC)
   - Exclusive vs Non-exclusive areas

2. Identify:
   - High capex but low utilization areas
   - Underperforming fibernodes

3. Compare monetization trend between:
   - Exclusive vs open access areas
   - FTTH vs HFC

4. What structural patterns do you observe in infrastructure performance?

# Section 2 – Servco Performance & Competition

1. Analyze Servco performance across:
   - Active CA growth
   - Lease revenue contribution
   - Penetration rate

2. Evaluate Servco 101 performance and penetration against minimum guarantee.

3. Compare performance:
   - In exclusive window vs post-exclusive
   - In single-ISP vs multi-ISP areas

---

# Section 3 – Media Monetization & Profitability

1. Calculate media attach rate per Servco and per region.

2. Analyze contribution:
   - Lease revenue vs Media revenue
   - Media margin by product

3. Identify:
   - Most profitable media product
   - Servco with strongest upsell capability
   - Regions with highest monetization potential

4. Is media bundling meaningfully improving ARPU?

---

# Section 4 – Strategic Recommendations

Based on your analysis:

1. What are the top 3 strategic priorities for the next 6 months?

2. Should FiberCo:
   - Expand FTTH more aggressively?
   - Continue exclusivity policy?
   - Encourage more multi-ISP competition?
   - Adjust media bundling strategy?

Support your recommendation with quantitative reasoning.
